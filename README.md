# Better Deep Dark

### A mod to upgrade Minecraft's Deep Dark

## Features

> NOTE: Some of these items seem kind of overpowered but trust me when you see the absolute walking death i plan to implement for the dimension, they seem kinda wimpy

### Currently Implemented features:

- Key alter - Sacrifice a wardens heart and see what happens...
- Skulk conduit block
  - Can only be activated by throwing a warden's heart into an alter atop a conduit
  - (DEVELOPMENT ONLY) can be reset by running /resetconduit while looking at
  - blocks are chained activating one will activate all connected and deactivating one will deactivate all connected
- Wardens heart - Beats ominously...
- Wardens sword (partially implemented)
  - Wardens Cry - After dealing sufficient damage, on next hit implements an AOE attack that damages all nearby entities (wolves excluded) and throws them away from the player, however if used near a shrieker will bypass cooldowns and immediately summon a warden. Can be canceled by crouching on next hit

### Planed Features

- Portal pylon - sits atop the massive tower structures near the portal, I wonder what happens when the conduit block below is activated...
- Wardens armor set
  - Helmet
    - Echolocation - Counteracts the darkness effect
  - Chestplate
    - Echo of The Abyss - Allows a player to create a sound blast similar to the wardens that will redistribute 75% of the damage they've taken in the last 15 seconds in straight line, ignoring all blocks except wool
  - Leggings
    - Abyssal Fortitude - Grants permanent resistance 2 while the player is below y = 0 or in the deep dark dimension
  - Boots
    - Abyssal veil - Allows the player to move without triggering sound sensitive blocks or entities, entities can still sniff the player as well as hear any sounds produced by the player interacting in the world or taking/dealing damage
- Wardens shield 
  - Echos Wrath - Reflects any projectiles at 1.5x the velocity in the direction they came from
- Wardens tools (hoe/axe/pickaxe/shovel)
  - Axe - Combo system rework 
  - Depth’s whisper - greatly decrease the range for which blocks broken by the tool can be heard from allowing easier breakage of shriekers and detectors
- Other enchantments
  - Chasm’s embrace (boots) - increases the height the player can fall from without taking damage ONLY while in the deep dark
  - Sculk Synergy (tools) - increases the tools mining speed based on the amount of sculk blocks nearby (accepts sculk block, sculk vein, sculk sensor, sculk catalyst)
  - Echo of catalysis (sword) - killing mobs  will spread nearby sculk regardless of whether a catalyst is present.
- Sculk apple - gives the standard golden apple effects
  - Whisper’s embrace - status effect that temporarily allows any action to be performed without alerting nearby sound sensitive blocks or entities
